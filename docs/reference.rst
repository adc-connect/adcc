API reference
=============

.. note::
   Work in progress. Many function do not yet follow
   the numpy standard in their documentation!

This page contains a structured overview of the python API of adcc.
See also the :ref:`genindex`.

.. _libadcc:

libadcc: Python bindings
------------------------------------

The libadcc Python module contains python bindings of :ref:`libadcc-layer`.
They are generated directly from the C++ source code
using `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io>`_
and the sources contained in the
`extension <https://github.com/adc-connect/adcc/tree/master/libadcc/pyiface>`_
subfolder of the adcc github repository.

It is not recommended to call these functions directly,
but instead resort to the higher-level functionality
from the :ref:`adccmodule`.

.. _libadcc-layer:

libadcc: C++ library
------------------------------------

A reference of the C++ part of *libadcc*
and its classes and functions can be found in the following.
The functions and classes discussed here are exposed to Python
as the :ref:`libadcc` python module.

Reference state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This category lists the *libadcc* functionality,
which imports the data from the :cpp:class:`libadcc::HartreeFockSolution_i`
interface into the :cpp:class:`libadcc::ReferenceState`
for internal use by the library.
See :ref:`hostprograms` for details how to connect
host programs to adcc.
Important classes in the process are :cpp:class:`libadcc::MoSpaces`,
which collects information about the occupied and virtual
orbital spaces, and :cpp:class:`libadcc::MoIndexTranslation`,
which maps orbitals indices between the ordering used by ``libadcc``
and the one used by the SCF program.

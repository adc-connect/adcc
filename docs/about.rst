About this project
==================

The adcc project was initiated in 2016 at Heidelberg University, where most
initial development took place. This first version of the code was heavily
inspired by the `adcman <http://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2013.859313>`_ package
by Michael Wormit *et. al.*.
Even thought the structure of adcc has changed a lot since the early days,
the code in its current stage would have been impossible without being able
to rigorously test and compare against adcman along the way.

A good overview of adcc and its features can be found in :cite:`adcc`.

# TODO
#    This interface is not that great and leads to duplicate information
#    (e.g. once for setting up the guesses and once for setting up the
#     explicit symmetrisation)
#    Maybe one could pass the guesses to these classes or construct
#    these classes along with the guesses or allow to do the guess symmetry
#    setup first and then use this symmetry setup for setting up both the
#    guesses and these classes (which is probably the best case)

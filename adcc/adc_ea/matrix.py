# TODO One thing one could still do to improve timings is implement a "fast einsum"
#      that does not call opt_einsum, but directly dispatches to libadcc. This could
#      lower the call overhead in the applies for the cases where we have only a
#      trivial einsum to do. For the moment I'm not convinced that is worth the
#      effort ... I suppose it only makes a difference for the cheaper ADC variants
#      (ADC(0), ADC(1), CVS-ADC(0-2)-x), but then on the other hand they are not
#      really so much our focus.

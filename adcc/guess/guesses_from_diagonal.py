    Obtain guesses by inspecting a block of the diagonal of the passed ADC
    matrix. The symmetry of the returned vectors is already set-up properly.
    Note that this routine may return fewer vectors than requested in case the
    requested number could not be found.

    matrix       The matrix for which guesses are to be constructed
    n_guesses    The number of guesses to be searched for. Less number of
                 vectors are returned if this many could not be found.
    block        Diagonal block to use for obtaining the guesses
                 (typically "ph" or "pphh").
    is_alpha     Is the detached/attached electron alpha spin for the 
                 respective IP-/EA-ADC calculation.
    spin_change  The spin change to enforce in an excitation.
                 Typical values are 0 (singlet/triplet/any) and -1 (spin-flip).
    spin_block_symmetrisation
                 Symmetrisation to enforce between equivalent spin blocks, which
                 all yield the desired spin_change. E.g. if spin_change == 0,
                 then both the alpha->alpha and beta->beta blocks of the singles
                 part of the excitation vector achieve a spin change of 0.
                 The symmetry specified with this parameter will then be imposed
                 between the a-a and b-b blocks. Valid values are "none",
                 "symmetric" and "antisymmetric", where "none" enforces
                 no particular symmetry.
    degeneracy_tolerance
                 Tolerance for two entries of the diagonal to be considered
                 degenerate, i.e. identical.
    max_diagonal_value
                 Maximal diagonal value, which is considered as a valid candidate
                 to form a guess.
